# prework-study-guide 
# <prework studyguide webpage>

## Description

we are creating a webpage to help breakdown the core elements of the prework bootcamp whilst making the sections easy ti follow along with and not making them overly contrived.

- we were motivated to fo this  project out of a need for a more accessible way of reading eavh core topic
- we built this as a test to out basic codeing knowledge and in a test of reading and porblem solving abilities
- it solves a problem of not knowing where to begin and what part of each topic to focus on in what order
- during this process i learned many different tips for understanding git bash along side some very basic webpage building abilities
